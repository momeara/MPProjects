qsub-slice
==========

This is a set of scripts for SGE/Grid-Engine that make running standard 
shell scripts in a map-reduce like fashion very easy. The qsub-mr script
takes (at minium) a line-wise input file and a map script to run. 

Workflow Overview
-----------------

 * Split the input file into M slices of N lines within the inputs/ direcotry
 * Create an SGE job with M individual tasks running the "map wrapper"
 * The stdout and stderr files for each task will be created in logs/
 * The map wrapper performs the following steps:
  - Identify the correct input file for the current task
  - Create a task-specfic local scratch directory
  - Run the specified map script with the task's input file as an argument
  - Upon completion (or failure) move the contents of the scratch directory
    into the outputs/ directory with a name corresponding to the original 
    input file.
 * If a reduce script is supplied, submit it to run once all tasks finish

Quick Notes
-----------

 * The number of lines per task can be adjusted with the -l argument
 * Map scripts can be called iteratively with the contents of each
   line of the input (opposed to being called with the path to the
   input file) by providing the -I argument. 
 * The maximum number of running tasks can be controlled via -tc
 * SGE/Grid-engine arguments are extracted from the map script and
   added to the submission arguments by default
 * For very large submissions (more than a few thousand tasks) consider
   using the qsub-mr-meta script, which further subdivides the overall
   work into multiple jobs to manage directory usage.
 * You can provide an environment to source prior to each map/reduce task
   via the -s argument. Note this currently expects an sh/bash file.
 * Eventually a native tcsh implementation will be via "-S tcsh"
